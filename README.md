# Heroes


##### Sample iOS app that interacts with the Marvel API

Built using Collection View `Compositional Layouts`, `Diffable Data Sources` and `Core Data`.

To run the app, specify valid API keys in the `token.json` file included in the main bundle. This is a one-off configuration run, once that's done, the keys will be stored in the keychain and the file won't be necessary.
